<h3>My Top 3 Elevator Pitches:</h3>
</br>
<p>
  1. For the fitness enthusiasts </br>
  who track their macros but are sick of adjusting them every time their weight changes </br>
  The Macro Go-Tracker </br>
  is a macro tracker </br>
  that automatically readjusts your macros based on your weekly weigh-in. </br>
  Unlike redoing your macro calculations manually every time your weight differs more than 5 lbs, </br>
  our product saves you time but automatically doing it when your weight has changed enough to make the macro change </br>
</p>

<p>
  2. For the foodies </br>
  who enjoy trying new restaurants and use reviews as a way to decide if the place is worth it or not </br>
  The Foodie Facts </br>
  is an opinion mining for automated restaurant review ratings </br>
  that take reviews and based on keywords from the reviews come up with an overall Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor rating of the restaurant. </br>
  Unlike reading through all the reviews or trying to figure out how to come to a conclusion, </br>
  our product will just put it out there for you and let you know if the restaurant is Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor without wasting time going through all the reviews to figure out if itâ€™s worth it or not. </br>
</p>

<p>
  3. For boutique owners </br>
  who need to keep track of inventory in their shop, </br>
  The Boutique Inventory Tracker </br>
  is an inventory system </br>
  that allows the owner to add, edit, and update all items in their boutique. </br>
  Unlike keeping track in a notebook, </br>
  our product lets you access it via the web so you can access it anywhere and never lose it. </br>
